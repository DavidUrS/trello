### My To Do App

This [project](duribe-challenge.s3-website-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com) is done in MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React and Node), can help us to manage our tasks in different work spaces, like our home, or in the office, this means, that several work spaces can be created and each space has its own tasks, these tasks currently have 3 states `Pending` `In Progress` and `Done`.

This application has a Backend and a FrontEnd.
The **Backend** was built in **NodeJs** with **Express**, as database was used **MongoDb** in **MongoAtlas**, some additional packages were used for functionality, such as `@hapi`, `bcrypt`, `dotenv`, `jsonwebtoken`, `mongoose`, among others.

For the **Frontend**, we used **ReactJs**, and we used some complementary technologies like `Redux`, `Redux-Forms`, `Redux-Saga`, `Material-Ui`, `Axios`, `markdown-react-js` among others.
